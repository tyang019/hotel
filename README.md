# 🏨 Hotel Billing System – Java OOP Project

This project simulates a **hotel billing system** using Java and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It models room charges, meal costs, taxes, tips, and other expenses for hotel guests, while tracking overall revenue statistics across all guests.

## 📌 Features

- 💵 Calculates total charges based on:
  - Room rate per night
  - Number of nights and guests
  - Meal costs per person per night
  - Fixed telephone charges
  - Tax and tip rates

- 📊 Tracks cumulative totals for all hotel guests, including:
  - Total room revenue
  - Total meal revenue
  - Total telephone revenue
  - Total tax and tips collected
  - Overall gross transaction total

- 🔁 Constructor overloading for different guest entry scenarios:
  - Just room number
  - Room number + nights
  - Room number + nights + guests

- ✅ Clean encapsulation through instance and static methods

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

- **Encapsulation**: Instance variables with accessors and mutators  
- **Static vs. Instance** variables and methods  
- **Constructor Overloading**  
- **Use of Constants** (`final` variables)  
- **Separation of Concerns** in method design
